## Environment Paths

- **Virtual Environment Location:**
  - `.venv/` directory in the project root: `C:\Users\pt971\code\db\.venv`
  - This directory contains the isolated Python environment for this project. It should NOT be committed to git (ensure `.venv/` is in `.gitignore`).

- **Python User Scripts Path:**
  - `C:\Users\pt971\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts`
  - This directory contains executables for user-installed Python packages, such as `uv.exe`.
  - This path should be included in your system/user PATH environment variable to make `uv` and other scripts available from any terminal.
